 * Production environment-specific settings and middleware. Modify this file as

 * For example, the default view engine is `jade`, but you can override that
 * setting here by adding:
 *
 *     app.set('view engine', 'ejs');
 *
 * If you wanted to use express logger middleware, you could register here like:
 *
 *     app.use(express.logger());
 *
 * @param {function(Object, Object, Function)} app Express application instance.
 * @param {Function} express Express/Connect instance.
